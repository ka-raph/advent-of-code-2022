# ka-raph's Advent of Code 2022's solutions

*Only JS for now, might try to add other languages later.*
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)


## Prerequisites

**Node.js**, any version should do, but the newer the better.


## Usage

To run a specific day's solutions, open a termminal in this folder and run:

```
node .\day<DAY_INDEX>\index.js
```

Replace `<DAY_INDEX>` with whichever day's solutions you want to run, e.g. to run the second day's solutions:

```
node .\day2\index.js
```


## Notes

I do not save the input in a text file but rather in a multiline string because there is no interest of adding the same boilerplate on each challenge for parsing text content into a string.

The goal of this repo is to showcase good (perhaps not objectively the best) approaches to the Advent of Code challenges that are neither too long nor too convoluted.

The solutions aren't necessarily the fastest nor the shortest, but I tried to make the code rather concise yet understandable, therefore no funky hacks nor ninja code whatsoever.

> I declare war to gibberish one-liners!

**The goal is to focus on the approach!**
