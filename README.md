# ka-raph's Advent of Code 2022's solutions

*Only JS for now, might try to add other languages later.*
[Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)


## Prerequisites

**Node.js**, any version should do, but the newer the better.


## Usage

To run a specific day's solutions, open a termminal in this folder and run:

```
node .\day<DAY_INDEX>\index.js
```

Replace `<DAY_INDEX>` with whichever day's solutions you want to run, e.g. to run the second day's solutions:

```
node .\day2\index.js
```


## Notes

The solutions aren't necessarily the fastest nor the shortest, but I tried to make the code rather concise yet understandable, therefore no funky hacks nor ninja code whatsoever.

> I declare war to gibberish one-liners!

**The goal is to focus on the approach!**
