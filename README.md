# ka-raph's Advent of Code 2022's solutions

*Only JS for now, might try to add other languages later*

## Prerequisites

**Node.js**, any version should do, but the newer the better.

## Usage

To run a specific day's solutions, open a termminal in this folder and run:

```
node .\day<DAY_INDEX>\index.js
```

Replace `<DAY_INDEX>` with whichever day's solutions you want to run, e.g. to run the second day's solutions:

```
node .\day2\index.js
```


## Notes

The solutions aren't necessarily the fastes nor the shortest, but I tried to make the code rather concise yet understandable, therefore no funky hacks nor ninja code whatsoever.

**The goal is to focus on the approach!**
